# Overview
This is a relatively simple boxing tournament simulator that I'm building to strengthen my knowledge of data structures (particularly array lists).
I also added additional complexity to explore different algorithms, solidify OOP, and work on cleaner ways to implement ideas.
## Goals
~~Fight class that conducts a fight between two fighters~~
~~Dynamic, single elimination tournament bracket that will pit seeded fighters against the appropriate opponent (i.e. input 1, output 8; input 2, output 7)~~
~~Pass winners of initial round to subsequent rounds and dynamically move through the correct series of rounds~~
~~Exchange mechanic that weights whether a fighter will engage and then influence scoring based on the results of exchanges~~
Trait system for fighters to act differently under different fight circumstances
Stamina, damage, and KO logic
Round robin style tournament bracket
Bridge round robin with single elimination (like group stage to knockout stage in football tournaments)
